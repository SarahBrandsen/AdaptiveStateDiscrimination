# AdaptiveStateDiscrimination
We develop adaptive techniques to approach quantum state discrimination over tensor product states. In particular, we consider a locally greedy adaptive scheme consisting of Bayesian updating of prior after each measurement and a dynamic-programming scheme which recursively minimizes expected future error.
